# docker-tess4j

TesserAct is an Open Source OCR tool (see http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

Tess4J is a Java JNA wrapper for TesserAct (see http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/) with all Windows dependencies combined.

For Linux some dependencies have to be installed. This Docker image provides all dependencies pre-installed, so Tess4J is good to go. English, French and Dutch languages installed.

Code example: see http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/codesample.html
